## About

SciArmy provides AI agents that assist with common research tasks like literature review, grant discovery, and peer review. The platform helps researchers work faster while maintaining quality.

## Built at Blocktrain Hackathon

This project was built during a 36-hour train journey from Bengaluru to Delhi as part of [Blocktrain](https://blocktrain.devfolio.co/) organized by Devfolio.

What we built in 36 hours:
- Full chat application with GitHub authentication
- 5 AI agent demonstrations with dynamic UI components
- Chat history persistence
- Live deployments (sciarmy.com & deck.sciarmy.com)

The agents currently provide simulated responses to demonstrate the concept.
